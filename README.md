3. "Tsunami" This flag is set to "1" for large events in oceanic regions and "0" otherwise. The existence or value of this flag does not indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist! (located inside the "tsunami" property)
4. The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location. (located inside the "nst" property)
